Context: Ethernet Layer 2 Switch
Vendor Supported: Cisco, Juniper
Command allow/deny>>interface
Description
  Deny (Allow) access to/from the switchport interface
Justification: Layer2 Switching manages access at the port level. Term "port" already exists in the Language Spec (3.1.2) as an 
  Idiom and referenced in the context of communications tranport. This could result in confusion. To avoid this, proposing the term for this TARGET 
  to be "interface." "Interface" is the logical representation of a physical port on a layer 2 switching device. It is referenced through 
  vendor command line interfaces in order to issue, e.g., a command to block (deny) access to the switchport. 
Deny would be a required action.. Allow would be optional.
Target specifier(s): interface_name, interface_ID, vlan_ID
Arguments: traffic_type:multicast/unicast
