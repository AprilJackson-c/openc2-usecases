# Update File

## Objective
This use case explores mechanisms for changinging the state of an actuator and identifies conditions
where the OpenC2 Update File command is an appropriate abstraction for a mechanism.

## Scenario
In the context of a device or application, changing state in a persistent manner requires updating
some data that resides in persistent storage.  Updates can be characterized as:
1. **incremental** - individual data items are changed step-by-step, such as typing characters in a text editor,
changing an individual registry key, modifying a single firewall rule
2. **batch** - a collection of data is changed as a unit, such as applying a patch to a file, copying or saving
a file, setting multiple registry keys as a unit, changing a firewall ruleset as a unit
