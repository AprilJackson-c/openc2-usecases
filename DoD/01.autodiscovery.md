# Actuator Autodiscovery
This use case describes how an OpenC2 producer [[1]("endnote1)] can
identify the type and capabilities of managed devices/agents.  It assumes that communication
with a device has already been established [[2](#endnote2)].  Autodiscovery is the machine-to-machine
equivalent of a **help** facility used by human operators to discover types, versions,
supported commands/options, and other features of managed devices.

## Endnotes
 1. <a name="endnote1">A **producer**</a> is an orchestrator, management application or other entity
 that controls the operation of an **actuator**.  The producer sends OpenC2 commands and
 receives responses from the actuator.  In a client-server environment the producer acts as the client
 and the actuator acts as a server listening for incoming commands.  In symmetric communication environments
 (pub/sub, message bus, p2p, connectionless, etc) the producer is the initiator and the actuator is the
 responder.
 2. <a name="endnote1">Communication</a> requirements are specified elsewhere
