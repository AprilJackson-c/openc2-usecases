# NETCONF Functions
The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is a network management
protocol developed and standardized by the IETF in
[RFC 6241](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6241).
NETCONF provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the
configuration of network devices, and supports robust configuration
change using transactions involving a number of devices.
Its operations are realized on top of a simple Remote Procedure Call (RPC) layer.
Protocol messages and configuration data are encoded in XML and
exchanged on top of a secure transport protocol.

The NETCONF protocol can be conceptually partitioned into four layers:

* The Content layer consists of configuration data and notification data.
* The Operations layer defines a set of base protocol operations to
  retrieve and edit the configuration data.
* The Messages layer provides a mechanism for encoding remote procedure
  calls (RPCs) and notifications.
* The Secure Transport layer provides a secure and reliable transport
  of messages between a client and a server.
