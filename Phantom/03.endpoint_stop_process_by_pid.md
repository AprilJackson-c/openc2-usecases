# 03.endpoint_stop_process_by_pid.md

This action instructs the operating system or security software on the endpoint to terminate the process with the given Process ID. The `process` and the `device` are at the same nesting level. This will be an implicit way to express that this action targets a process running on a device, which will be expressed in the actuator profile for endpoints.

```
{
  "action": "stop",
  "target": {
    "process": {
      "pid": 1234
    },
    "device": {
      "hostname": "198.51.100.131"
    }
  },
  "actuator": {
    "endpoint": "my_endpoint_actuator_name"
  }
}
