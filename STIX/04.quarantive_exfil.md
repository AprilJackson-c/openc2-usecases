# Quarantine of Exfiltrating Server

A threat intelligence provider (SuperThreat) has detected that 
an organization (ACME) has a server that is being used by an 
adversary to exfiltrate sensitive information. 
SuperThreat sends an Observed-Data bundled with a 
CoA describing how to quarantine the affected server. 
ACME receives the CoA and runs it. 
The first action-step is an OpenC2 command sent to an 
SDN controller to quarantine the affected server. 
Then a textual action-step describes the 
creation of a ticket that will be used by ACME to track 
the quarantined server as additional investigation is undertaken.
