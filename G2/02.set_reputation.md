# Set Reputation of a Malicious File (Retrospective)

## Objective
This use case was created in order to explore a retrospective view, in accordance with working draft 04 of the OpenC2 language specification, of the use case described in [01.set_reputation.md](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-lsc-usecases/blob/master/G2/01.set_reputation.md). The plan is to continue to do these retrospectives throughout the OpenC2 language development lifecycle to gain understanding and help shape the future of the OpenC2.

## OpenC2 Complete Messsage
Here we present the complete OpenC2 message for this retrospective use case. Then we will discuss the bare bones actuator profile we created for this use case. Followed by a in-depth look at each section of the message.

## Threat Intelligence Actuator Profile
There is no actuator profile for threat intelligence functionality and therefore no properties table for reputation or device. For the purposes of this use case we will create a bare bones actuator profile for "threat intelligence" that contains the reputation and device property tables.
### Reputation Properties Table 
| ID 	| Element Name 	| Type            	| Description                                                	|
|----	|--------------	|-----------------	|------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1  	| type         	| {file, domain}  	| The type of object for which the reputation should be set  	|
| 2  	| name         	| string          	| The name of the file or domain                             	|
| 3  	| severity     	| int             	| Score from 0-7, with 0 being trusted and 7 being known bad 	|
| 4  	| comment      	| string          	| Comment of justification as to why this was set            	|
| 5  	| Hashes       	| Hash List       	| List of hashes and associated types                        	|
| 6  	| IPs          	| IP List         	| List of IPs and associated types                           	|
### Device Properties Table
| ID 	| Element Name 	| Type            	| Description                                                	|
|----	|--------------	|-----------------	|------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1  	| hostname      | string	  	| The hostname of device			  		|
| 2  	| ipv4_addr     | ipv4-addr	  	| The ip version 4 of a device  				|
| 3  	| ipv6_addr     | ipv6-addr	  	| The ip version 6 of a device				  	|
| 4  	| id    	| string	  	| The registered device id				  	|


## OpenC2 action block
Not much has changed here, we decided to stay with the action verb "set" because we felt that as of the current version of the OpenC2 language it still filled our requirements.
```json
	"action": "set",
```
## OpenC2 target block
Here is where things start to diverge. Not only did we move away from "file" as our target but we also modified the structure of our definition in accordance with our reading of the current version of the OpenC2 language. The decision to move away from "file" as a target was a contested one but we felt that it was the right one. The main reason for this change was to not pollute file target properties. Additionally, we felt that the action of setting a reputation was not being performed directly on a file but rather referenced a potentially non-existent file on a potentially non-existent system.

### Target-name and target-specifiers
Although discussed in the current version of the OpenC2 language specification, no current use case utilizes these constructs. We decided to utilize them in our use case because we felt that it organized the data well. Additionally, it allowed us to be more specific with our target. We chose "artifact" because we felt it was the only target flexible enough to be further specified into "reputation". However, we believe the language would be better served if we added a new target construct such as "object", "data", or "other". Additionally, we believe that "reputation" and all its property tables should be further defined within the actuator profile that utilizes it as a target-specifier.
```json	
	"target":{ 
		"target-name": "artifact",
		"target-specifiers":{
		  "type": "reputation"
		},
```
We also see a case for utilizing the above-mentioned strategy to define targets from other specifications, aka "namespaces". The following could be an example of this. With the main difference here being that the actuator profile would not need to define all the property tables related to the target-specifier, but rather simply state that target-specifier X is modeled from specification Y. For this example assume that specification Y = STIX, and target-specifier X = stix-indicator.
```json	
	"target":{ 
		"target-name": "artifact",
		"target-specifiers":{
		  "type": "stix-indicator"
		},		
```
### Target properties
No target-options were set for this use case. The properties to be set are as follows in accordance with our target properties table. Notice not all properties are used, just the ones we need.
```json	
		"target-options":{},
		"reputation": { 
			"type": "file",
			"name": "evil.exe",
			"severity": 7, 
			"comment": "Reputation assessed by STIX, set via OpenC2",
			"hashes":[
				{
				"value": "098F6BCD4621D373CADE4E832627B4F6",
				"type": "md5"
				},
				{
				"value": "A94A8FE5CCB19BA61C4C0873D391E987982FBBD3",
				"type": "sha1"
				}
			]
		}
	},
```
In relation to the point discussed ealier about namespaces. Assuming that the actuator profile has defined the use of STIX namespace we could take the following blob.
```xml
<stix:Indicators>
        <stix:Indicator xsi:type="indicator:IndicatorType" id="example:Indicator-611935aa-4db5-4b63-88ac-ac651634f09b" timestamp="2014-05-08T09:00:00.000000Z">

                        <FileObj:Hashes>
                            <cyboxCommon:Hash>
                                <cyboxCommon:Type xsi:type="cyboxVocabs:HashNameVocab-1.0" condition="Equals">MD5</cyboxCommon:Type>
                                <cyboxCommon:Simple_Hash_Value condition="Equals" apply_condition="ANY">01234567890abcdef01234567890abcdef##comma##abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890##comma##00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff</cyboxCommon:Simple_Hash_Value>
                            </cyboxCommon:Hash>
                        </FileObj:Hashes>
                    </cybox:Properties>
                </cybox:Object>
            </indicator:Observable>
        </stix:Indicator>
```

## OpenC2 actuator block
Originally we did not have an actuator block since we only had one actuator in our reference implementation. However, in hindsight it made more sense for us to be unanbiguos when it came to defining the actuator.

### Actuator-name and actuator-specifier
Similarly to target we decided to use the same construct called out in the current version of the OpenC2 language specification. Here we call out the ealier alluded to "threat intelligence" actuator. We further specify which actuator by utilizing the "device" actuator-specifier. This enables us to later utilize this actuator-specifier in order to call out the "McAfee_TIE_01" hostname. There are potentially many ways to do this but we wanted to keep some continuity with the way target-specifiers were ealier defined. By doing it this way we allowed the actuator profile to also define how it can be referenced.
```json
"actuator":{ 
		"actuator-name": "Threat Intelligence",
		"actuator-specifiers":{
		  "type": "hostname"
		},
		"actuator-options":{
		  "ap_version": "1.1"
		},
		"hostname": "McAfee_TIE_01"
	},
```
## OpenC2 command-options block
Originally we had command-options but we used the block incorrectly. This example displays information that is better suited to be displayed in a comman-options block.

### Id and version
We did not really need it but it seemed like a good place to add this type of information. 
```json
"command-options":{
		"command_id": "ABCDEF123456789",
		"start_time": 1519247125,
		"periodicity": "once",
		"duration": "permanent",
		"openc2_version": "1.6"
	}
}
```
## Curiosity
Should action-specifiers and/or action-options exist?
