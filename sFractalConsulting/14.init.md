# Web Server Initialization Use Case
This use case contains the OpenC2 commands to setup the 00.websvr_basecase.md use case.

Note this is a 'build' vs 'response' or 'incremental' usecase 
(using Sounil terminology to distinguish 'start up' 
vs response at cyber speed).
As such, some may consider it out of scope for OpenC2 
(or at least not for initial consideration). 
It is included here just for completeness.
If there is a better way to do it, 
then sFractal will consider switching to that.
