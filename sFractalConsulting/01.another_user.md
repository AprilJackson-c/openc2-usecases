# Add Another User

![fw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-lsc-usecases/master/sFractalConsulting/images/03.fw.png)

Initial condition is the configuration in [00.websvr_basecase.md](./00.websvr_basecase.md).
User2 is connected to Webserver1, FW5 only allows in port 80 from the internet, 
and FW1 blocks all ip's and all ports other than those specifically established in the base case.

The owner of the configuration, sFractal, decides to allow another user access to the WS1 API.
Out of band, sFractal authenticates this other user (User6)
and provides 
both User6 and FK1 a private key specifically for link 
establishment<sup>[1](#endnote1)</sup> of the User6/WS1 link.
WS1 is protected by some of the precepts of the Cloud Security Alliance's 
Software Defined Perimter<sup>[2](#endnote2)</sup>
including Single Packet Authorization (SPA)<sup>[3](#endnote3)</sup>
and pinhole firewall rules.

User6 sends a SPA packet on port 80 which makes it thru FW5 and is stopped by FW6 on VM1.

![fk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-lsc-usecases/master/sFractalConsulting/images/06.fk.png)

VM1, in addition to WS1 and FW6, has FK1 running on it.
FK1 is an instance of fwknop<sup>[4](#endnote4)</sup>.
FK1 watches all incoming packets looking for SPA packets so it detects the User6 SPA packet
from ip=6.6.6.6.
Since it is a valid SPA packet, FK1 decides to open FW6 to allow User6 to establish a connection.
For simplicity in this use case, FK1 will send an OpenC2 command to FW6.
Another use case would be for FK1 to send an OpenC2 alert 
(or a CSA SDP command<sup>[5](#endnote5)</sup>)
to the Security Orchestrator which would in turn send an OpenC2 command to FW6.

The OpenC2 command will need to temporarily open port 80 from ip 6.6.6.6 to WS1.
Per CSA SDP the pinhole is both pinhole in both space (ip/port) and time.
Therefore the allow command is temporary, just long enough
to allow the establishment of the connection.
Since FW6 is a stateful firewall, 
the established User6-WS1 connection 
will stay up one the allow expires.

FK1 sends the following to FW6:

 put allow command here

User6 then establishes an HTTPS connection to WS1.

The allow expires in FW6 but the User6 - WS1 connection stays up since FW6 
is a stateful firewall.

Definition of Done:
  * User6 has established connection to WS1
