# Sense Making Base Case

## Objective
This is not a use case for OpenC2 but is a setup of initial conditions for at least one other use case.
This adds another application, for sense-making, to the previous initial conditions.

## Initial Conditions

![fw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-lsc-usecases/master/sFractalConsulting/images/03.fw.png)

Initial condition is the configuration in [00.websvr_basecase.md](./00.websvr_basecase.md).

## Sense Making

In a subsequent use case, [04.sensemaking.md](./04.sensemaking.md), the security orchestrator 
(which is performing the decision making function<sup>[1](#endnote1)</sup>
and sending OpenC2 commands to actuators)
would like to augment it's own information with information from other sources.
It will query a sense-making function<sup>[2](#endnote2)</sup>.
For these use cases the application queried will just be called SM8, for the sense-making application 
on VM8.
Examples of sense-making functions provided by this application might include:
 * ip reputation services
 * dns reputation services
 * ip geolocation services
 * ip netlocation  services (ie where wrt routing) 
 * malware recognition services (eg hashes)
 * etc

For the purposes of these usecases, the exact sense-making application used is immaterial.

## End Notes
 1. <a name="endnote1">IACD</a> function descriptions will be used in these use cases. Decision-making is an IACD function defined in (put link to glossary term here).
 2. <a name="endnote1">IACD</a> function descriptions will be used in these use cases. Sense-making is an IACD function defined in (put link to glossary term here).
