# Sensing

## Objective
This use case shows how OpenC2 commands can be sent to a sensor to command sensing (in this case logging).

## Initial Conditions

![fw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-lsc-usecases/master/sFractalConsulting/images/03.fw.png)

Initial condition is the configuration in [00.websvr_basecase.md](./00.websvr_basecase.md)
which includes:
  * the two firewalls (FW5, FW1) and the logger (LG4) are connected<sup>[1](#endnote1)</sup> to the security orchestrator (SO3)
  * the two firewalls (FW5, FW1) have a connection<sup>[1](#endnote1)</sup> to the logger (LG4).

## Scenario

The security orchestrator SO3 decides<sup>[2](#endnote2)</sup>
to increase logging on traffic to/from ip=7.7.7.7. 
Traffic from 7.7.7.7 is currently blocked outbound on all ports in both FW1 and FW7, 
and is blocked inbound on all ports by FW1 and inbound on all but port 443 by FW7.

SO3 sends the following commands to FW1 and FW5:
```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "scr_addr": {"ipv4": "7.7.7.7"}, 
      "dst_addr": "any",
      "layer4_protocol": "any", 
      "dst_port": "any",
      "src_port": "any",
      "log": "verbose"
      }
    },
  "actuator": {"firewall": {"asset_id": "FW1"}},
}
```

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "scr_addr": "any",
      "dst_addr": {"ipv4": "7.7.7.7"}, 
      "layer4_protocol": "any", 
      "dst_port": "any",
      "src_port": "any",
      "log": "verbose"
      }
    },
  "actuator": {"firewall": {"asset_id": "FW1"}},
}
```

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "scr_addr": {"ipv4": "7.7.7.7"}, 
      "dst_addr": "any",
      "layer4_protocol": "any", 
      "dst_port": "any",
      "src_port": "any",
      "log": "verbose"
      }
    },
  "actuator": {"firewall": {"asset_id": "FW5"}},
}
```

```json
{
  "action": "deny",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "scr_addr": "any",
      "dst_addr": {"ipv4": "7.7.7.7"}, 
      "layer4_protocol": "any", 
      "dst_port": "any",
      "src_port": "any",
      "log": "verbose"
      }
    },
  "actuator": {"firewall": {"asset_id": "FW5"}},
}
```

After the commands are sent, the actuators (FW1,FW5) log the requested events 
and send to the logger (LG4).

# Definition of Done
FW1 and FW5 log all activity on ip=7.7.7.7 and send to logger (LG4).

# Stories
> As {a role}, I want {feature} so that {reason}.
  * As SO3, I want to send an OpenC2 command to tell FW1 and FW5 to log all traffic attempts to/from ip=7.7.7.7.

# End Notes
 1. <a name="endnote1">the</a> details of the connection are immaterial to this use case. One potential is that the connection is an api connection similar to the one set up in [00.websvr_basecase.md](./00.websvr_basecase.md) between User2 and WS1 (ie a secure API).
 2. <a name="endnote2">why</a> SO3 decides this is immaterial to this use case. Maybe it received a "mitigate ip=7.7.7.7" from another security orchestrator. Or maybe it received a STIX report on a particular campaign and this is how SO3's playbook decided to handle it. Or ...
