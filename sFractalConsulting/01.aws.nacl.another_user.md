# Add Another User

## Objective
This is a particular instantiation of 
[01.another_user.md](./01.another_user.md).
This use case shows the OpenC2 commands 
involved in allowing another user access to a webserver (WS)1 API
when FW5 is AWS NACL.

## Initial Conditions

See [01.another_user.md](./01.another_user.md).

## Scenario

See [01.another_user.md](./01.another_user.md).
The particular part of interest is:

... The net result of all these usecases is an allow command is sent to FW5 ...

In this case, FW5 is AWS NACL which is a stateless packet filter. 
AWS has two cloud firewalls, the stateless NACL and stateful security groups. 
This use case will cover AWS NACL and a different 
one will show the security group.

## OpenC2 JSON Allow Command
The command JSON data is:

```json
{
  "id": "0e0f9f68-0fcb-40ce-a03e-0ddd415fd1ff",
  "action": "allow",
  "target": {
    "ip_connection": {
      "ipv4_src": "6.6.6.6", 
      "ipv4_dst": "1.1.1.1", 
      "layer4_protocol": "TCP", 
      "dst_port": 443,
      "src_port": 44306
      }
    },
  "actuator": {
    "x_aws_lycan_beam": {
      "aws_account_id" : "123445689", 
      "aws_region" : "us-east-1",
      "aws_vpc_id": "vpc-123"
      }
    },
  "options": {
    "x_aws_nacl_id": "acl-123",
    "start_time": "now",
    "response_requested": "Ack"
    }
}
```

This command does have an actuator and it includes the 
specifiers needed to address it.
This particular actuator is a custom extension to the SLPF actuator profile.
(see later seftion on custom actuator profile)

## Response
Since the communications channel is over an https connection,
the https response code is 200/OK.
The data returned is JSON:
```
{
    "response_code" : "Command Accepted",
    "id": "0e0f9f68-0fcb-40ce-a03e-0ddd415fd1ff",
}
```

## Definition of Done:
  * User6 has established connection to WS1

## OpenC2 Stories:
> As {a role}, I want {feature} so that {reason}.
  * As FK1 (or as SO3), I want to send an OpenC2 command to tell FW5 to allow src_ip=6.6.6.6 port 44306 to dst_ip=1.1.1.1 port 443 so that User6 can establish a connection to WS1

## Custom Actuator Profile
In this usecase the particular actuator is a custom extension 
to the SLPF actuator profile.
This can be seen by doing the query command

## OpenC2 JSON Profile Query Command
```
{
  "id": "0d30e0f2-0778-4023-b013-06d76c2e67d7",
  "action": "query",
  "target": {
    "openc2": {
      "schema": ""
      }
    },
  "actuator": {
    "x_aws_lycan_beam": {
      "aws_account_id" : "123445689", 
      "aws_region" : "us-east-1"
      }
    }
}
```
