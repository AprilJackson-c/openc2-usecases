# IoT Base Case
This use case is the base architecture used in several other use cases

Unlike (ref to other base case), this set of usecases 
are not in the cloud 
but in sFractal's place of business (aka Duncan's house and vacation house).
Being a gadget freek, there are alot of 'things' 
in Duncan's Internet of Things (IoT) spread across 2 houses in 2 states:
 * 12 Sonos speaker-pairs (2 houses)
 * 8 NEST thermostats (1 in house1, 7 in house2 which is an hvac nightmare with 3 independent systems)
 * numerous CO, smoke, water alarms
 * numerous door/window/glassbreak alarms
 * many security webcams indoor and out (2 houses - and I'll confess they aren't all for security. Sometime we just like to look at the lake or the pool or or the flowers or check the driveway is ploughed etc)
 * family computers, phones, tablets
 * apple TV's, cable modems, smart TV's, etc.
 * numerous networking devices
 * too many old computers, arduino's, raspberry pi'd, etc to count
 * my car (yes my car hooks into my home wifi to update it's sofware)

I'm embarrased to say this in an incomplete list 
and it's likely to get longer with time.

Right now home security is done in one house by a large ISP 
and in the other by a small local provider.
The following use cases are assuming OpenC2 suceeds and one of the two
offers a 'manage my IoT' service so they will monitor for attacks
against me or by me 
(ie my 'things' get compromised in an attack against me 
and then used in an attack on someone else) 
and mitigate automagically.
